# Project Description

In your project, you will develop a forecast or pattern recognition based on machine learning technologies, which we also cover in our lecture. Your first task is defining a research question, which then determines your project work. To do this, proceed as follows:

  1. Think about what you would like to know (your **own curiosity** is a good advisor).
      1. Which subject area and which relationships have you always wanted to analyze?
      1. Which question (which includes a forecast or pattern detection) do you find particularly interesting?
      1. Try to move **from a general to a specific question**.
      1. Is the question a **classification** or a **regression** task?
  2. Check what data you need to perform your analysis.
      1. Which **data sets** are available for this analysis?
      1. What is the **data quality** of datasets you can find?
      1. Do you need to merge data? (**data fusion**)
  2. Submit a **proposal** to your lecturer. In your proposal you must characterize:  
      1. What is your **research question**?
      1. What **data** do you **need** to work on the research question?
      1. What **problems** do you **expect** during processing?
      1. What is your **schedule** for the project?
  4. Work on your project tasks.
      1. Consider possible **variants** in the processing. Demonstrate how you proceeded in the evaluation of variants.
      1. When presenting your results, **justify why** you have **decided** for or against a particular method/algorithm.

When defining the task, you may also find inspiration by the list of dataset repositories and datasets provided below. If you have any questions about defining your topic, please contact us via Teams. If you do not want or cannot define a topic by yourself, we will also offer topics that you can choose to work on.

Happy exploration in finding and working on your project! ü§©

## üìñ Guidelines
Your project work is organized via a GitHub Classroom. That means that you submit your results via GitHub. Make sure that not only one team member delivers results, as the participation in the project is also evaluated. We can see in the commit history (what was devlivered by whom and in which time periods).  

Your proposal will be submitted via Moodle (file upload task). Of course, you are welcome to place your proposal in GitHub. In that case, you must simple provide a text with a link to your GitHub submission (commit hash) to indicate that your proposal resides in GitHub.

We recommend to develop your proposal in discussion with your lecturers. A good process is to think about research questions which are interesting to your team, explore them (see the steps above) and then ask for feedback. Of course, you may also ask for feedback for different alternatives.

**Information**: This explanation is also put into your classroom assignment repository. You may delete or modify it there. Additionally, you may create structures (folders and files) on your own within your repository. All your code and findings must be placed inside this repository.
